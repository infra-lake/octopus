# Octagon

Octagon is made to setup anything in a simple way. It could be understood as an alternative to [Terraform](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform), [Pulumi](https://github.com/pulumi/pulumi), etc. Octagon can operate systems by their own APIs (like Terraform do), but without need to keep any separated state (such as [`.tfstate` file](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/state)). All infrastructure state is the configuration files, it makes operation more simpler than Terraform. With Octagon the configuration files is the source of truth.

Octagon is completely written in JavaScript and uses the [Handlebars](https://github.com/handlebars-lang/handlebars.js/) powers to provide a template language. Octagon is extensible, [supports additional plugins](#creating-a-plugin) and has some [built-in helpers](#built-in-helpers) to do common things like reading file contents, reading environment variables, and so on.

## How to use it?

To use Octagon, the first thing is to understand how does the [lifecycles](#lifecycles) works. After that, it is necessary to choose a [plugin](#plugin-list) and specify the plugin resources by writing configuration files. It is possible to use [helpers](#built-in-helpers) to write configuration files too.

### Lifecycles

The main objective of defining the Octagon lifecycles is to make a standard operation, independent of each system and, at the same time, respecting its particularities. Actually, Octagon has two lifecycles:

1. [Update Resources Lifecycle](#update-resources-lifecycle): Used to keep already created resources and just modify them as per config file data. It is enabled by default or when setting the `recreate="false"` argument; or 
2. [Recreate Resources Lifecycle](#recreate-resources-lifecycle): Used to recreate resource on every execution. It is enabled when setting the `recreate="true"` argument.

Some plugins could not support `recreate="false"` lifecycle, this infomation can be found at the plugin docs.  

#### Update Resources Lifecycle

The lifecycle of update resources has the following lifecycle:



#### Recreate Resources Lifecycle

The lifecycle of recreate resources has the following lifecycle:


### Plugin List

Nowadays octagon supports operation for these systems as plugins:

|**System**|**Plugin**|**Description**|**Docs**|
|-|-|-|-|
|[Airbyte](https://airbyte.com/)|`airbyte`|Read `workflows` and Manage `sources`, `destinations` and `connections` by [Airbyte Cloud API](https://reference.airbyte.com/reference/start).
